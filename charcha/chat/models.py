    There are 4 type of channels - 
    1. 1-1 chat between two members
    2. group chat between multiple members
    3. private chat between multiple members
    4. public chat between multiple members

    The difference between 2 and 3 - group chat is a temporary channel, 
    while a private chat is a named channel that is intended to be long lived

    Difference between public and private chat - any team member can join a public 
    chat without an explict invite.
